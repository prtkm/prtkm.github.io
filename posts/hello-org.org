Here I try to make an example post using org-mode. I am using the orgmode plugin for Nikola found [[https://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode][here]]. 

First let's embed a code block. The org extension to Nikola uses pygments to colorize code blocks. To do that we need to make some modifications to the css file provided by my theme zen-jinja.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pygmentize -S default -a .highlight -f html >> custom.css
cat custom.css >> ../themes/zen-jinja/assets/css/main.css
rm custom.css
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Now we can have a python code block that makes a plot.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1,2,4], [1,2,4])
plt.savefig('../images/demo-plot.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+ATTR_HTML: width="200px"
[[file:../../images/demo-plot.png]]

To get this to show up on the website I had to specify the image link as 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[[file:../../images/demo-plot.png]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a little weird since the path in link is different from where I actually save the image. This is because when nikola builds the post it is saved as ~/output/posts/hello-org/index.html~ and the image path is two levels up in ~/output/images/~. It will probably require some rearrangement in ~conf.py~ to get the images to show up both inline in my org file and in the exported html.


Now let's add an equation to see if it gets rendered with MathJax.

\begin{equation}
y = e^{x}
\end{equation}

I had to set 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
MATHJAX_CONFIG = '''
<script src='https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>
'''
#+END_SRC

in the ~conf.py~ file to get this to work.

I am a fourth year PhD student in Chemical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, working in the group of  [[https://schneidergroup.github.io][Professor William F. Schneider]]. I am interested in the design of new or improved materials for energy conversion and energy storage using theory and simulation. My current research involves the development of a non-thermal-plasma-enabled catalytic process that may help enable sustainable, low-temperature and low-pressure ammonia production. I have also worked on understanding the behavior of catalytic interfaces, calculating accurate free energies for catalytic reactions, and the discovery of descriptors for ionic mobility in solid-state battery electrolytes.
